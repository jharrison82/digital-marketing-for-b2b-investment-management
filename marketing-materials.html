						<p>In this chapter we will perform an audit of existing marketing materials, review how they are hosted, ensure that downloads can be tracked by the marketing automation system, and make all documents easily accessible by the sales teams.<p>	
						
						<h2 id="document-types" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Document types</h2>
						
						<p>Marketing teams at investment managers usually create and maintain a range of materials about the firm and the products and services it offers, as shown in figure 1, which salespeople use with their clients and prospects.</p>

						<p>The key documents here are the range of factsheets, flyers, pitchbooks/presentations and commentaries produced for each strategy and pooled fund:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Factsheets</strong>. Produced periodically (monthly or quarterly) with information on portfolio holdings and investment performance.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Pitchbooks/presentations</strong>. A detailed document covering the investment philosophy &amp; process, people, performance, and the investment case</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Flyers</strong>. A short document (usually around 1 or 2 pages) using key content from the pitchbook/presentation.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Commentaries</strong>. Produced periodically (monthly or quarterly) with performance commentary, attribution, any changes to portfolio holdings, and an outlook.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Some larger firms have tools or software that allow salespeople to create their own customised pitchbooks/presentations, usually by choosing slides from a library. However, we are only concerned with standardised "evergreen" materials.</p>
											
						<h3 id="investment-performance-considerations" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment performance considerations</h3>
						
						<p>Unlike with pooled funds &mdash; where a single investment vehicle is held by multiple investors &mdash; separately managed accounts are managed on an individual basis for each account holder, who are sent detailed reports listing every individual security held in their portfolio.</p>
						
						<p>To display investment performance (and other characteristics) of a specific strategy in marketing materials, investment managers use a <strong>composite portfolio</strong>, which is made up of all portfolios they manage according to the strategy (<a class="external" href="https://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/gips-standards-for-firms/" target="_blank">investment performance standards</a> set out by the CFA Institute aim to standardise this kind of reporting).</p>
												
						<p>For pooled funds, although the portfolio of underlying investments is the same for all investors, investment performance &mdash; along with some other characteristics, such as fees &mdash; vary for each share class. Therefore, a separate factsheet is typically published for each share class.</p>
						
						<p>Some marketing material aims to promote pooled funds without any focus on a particular share class (such as a flyer). However, to display investment performance on these documents, a share class must still be chosen.</p>
						
						<p>For UCITS pooled funds, as share classes of a single fund may be registered in different countries, this raises a potential issue for the compliance team: what if the chosen share class is not registered in the country of an individual who may see the document? However, there are several potential solutions to this:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li class="ps-2 mb-3">Choose a "default" share class for displaying investment performance on any fund-level documents, and either register that share class in all countries the pooled fund is available in, or add relevant disclaimers.</li>
							<li class="ps-2 mb-3">Show investment performance of the composite portfolio of the relevant investment strategy used to manage the fund instead.</li>
							<li class="ps-2 mb-3">Only produce pooled fund materials at a share class level (like factsheets).</p>
						</ol>

						<h3 id="lewishams-marketing-materials" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Regulatory documents</h3>
						
						<p>In addition to marketing materials, there are some regulatory materials which you might want to include in the audit, such as a <strong>prospectus</strong>, <strong>annual report</strong>, or <strong>semi-annual report</strong> (required documents for a pooled fund range) or a <strong>key investor information document (KIID)</strong> or <strong>key investor document (KID)</strong> required for each UCITS share class.</p>

						<p>Although they can be quite dry, they are often used by prospects seeking detailed information before they make investment decisions, so we may also want to track their downloads. However, this can be a large task to maintain, so consider it carefully.</p>
