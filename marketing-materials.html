						<p>In this chapter we will perform an audit of existing marketing materials, review how they are hosted, ensure that downloads can be tracked in the marketing automation system, and make all documents easily accessible by the sales teams.<p>	
						
						<h2 id="document-audit" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Document audit</h2>
		
						<p>Marketing teams at investment managers usually create and maintain a range of standard materials about the firm and the products and services it offers, which they use in their marketing activities. Salespeople use these materials with their clients and prospects.</p>
						
						<p>Performing an audit allows us to understand what is being produced.</p>
						
						<h3 id="investment-performance-considerations" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment strategy and vehicle materials</h3>												
						<p>The first step is to identify the types of documents the marketing team creates for individual investment strategies and vehicles, which may include:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Factsheets</strong>. Produced periodically (monthly or quarterly) with information on portfolio holdings and investment performance.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Pitchbooks/presentations</strong>. A detailed document covering the investment philosophy &amp; process, people, performance, and the investment case. Some firms have software that allow salespeople to create their own customised documents, usually by choosing slides from a library, but we are only concerned with standardised materials.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Flyers</strong>. A short document (usually around 1 or 2 pages) using key content from the pitchbook/presentation.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Commentaries</strong>. Produced periodically (monthly or quarterly) with performance commentary, attribution, any changes to portfolio holdings, and an outlook.</li>
						</ul>
													
						<p>Note that standard materials are not typically produced for <a href="/products.html#separately-managed-accounts">separately managed accounts</a>, which are managed on an individual basis for each account holder, who receive detailed reports listing every individual security held in their portfolio.</p>
						
						<p>Most document types will be produced on a one-to-one basis: a single document for each investment strategy or vehicle. For pooled funds, however, some documents &mdash; such as the factsheet &mdash; are typically published separately for each share class.</p>
												
						<p>Once we know the exisiting document types, we can then check which of the firm's investment strategies, vehicles, and share classes (which we identified in <a href="/products.html">the products &amp; services chapter</a>) each type of document is being produced for. Resource contraints sometimes limit the number of materials that can be created and maintained.</p>
						
						<h4 id="investment-performance-considerations" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Considerations for displaying investment performance</h4>	

						<p>Investment managers use <strong>composite portfolios</strong> to display investment performance for investment strategies on marketing materials. A composite is made up of all portfolios managed according to a single strategy (<a class="external" href="https://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/gips-standards-for-firms/" target="_blank">investment performance standards</a> set out by the CFA Institute aim to standardise and improve this kind of reporting).</p>						
												
						<p>To display investment performance of any pooled fund materials produced on a one-to-one basis (i.e., not focused on a particular share class) the marketing team typically selects a single share class of the fund. As share classes of a single <a href="/products.html#ucits-funds">UCITS fund</a> can be registered in different countries, this can raise a potential issue for the compliance team: what if the chosen share class isn't registered in the country of an individual who can access the document because another share class of the fund is registered in their country?</p>
						
						<p>There are several approaches that can be taken to avoid this issue:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li class="ps-2 mb-3">Choose a "default" share class for displaying investment performance on any fund-level documents, and either register the share class in all countries the pooled fund is available in, or add relevant disclaimers.</li>
							<li class="ps-2 mb-3">Show investment performance of the composite portfolio of the relevant investment strategy used to manage the fund instead.</li>
							<li class="ps-2 mb-3">Only produce pooled fund materials at a share class level.</p>
						</ol>					
																					
						<h3 id="investment-performance-considerations" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Other materials</h3>
															
						<p>Once the range of materials for individual investment strategies and vehicles have been identified, the next step is to gather any other materials around the firm, products, and services, which should be more straightforward.</p>

						<h3 id="lewishams-marketing-materials" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Regulatory documents</h3>
						
						<p>Finally, you may wish to include some key regulatory documents in the audit, such as a <strong>prospectus</strong>, <strong>annual report</strong>, or <strong>semi-annual report</strong> (required documents for each range of pooled funds) or a <strong>key investor information document (KIID)</strong> or <strong>key investor document (KID)</strong> (required for each UCITS share class).</p>

						<p>Although they can be quite dry, they are often used by prospects seeking detailed information before they make investment decisions, so we may also want to track their downloads. However, this can be a large task, so consider it carefully.</p>

						<h3 id="languages" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Languages</h3>
						
						<p>You should include any marketing materials the firm produces in any additional languages in the audit. These languages will have been documented in the <a href="https://digital-marketing-for-b2b-investment.management/languages.html">languages chapter</a>.</p>
