						<p>In this chapter, we will research and document the range of <strong>investment strategies</strong>, associated <strong>investment vehicles</strong> (which make strategies available for investment), and any other <strong>services</strong> offered by the investment manager we work for.<p>
						
						<h2 id="investment-strategies" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment strategies</h2>	
						
						<p>An investment strategy is simply an approach to investing in some area of the financial markets. Once an area of focus is chosen &mdash; such as the global stock market, U.S. stock market, or European bond market &mdash; an appropriate <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp" target="_blank">market index</a> is selected, which makes up the universe of available investments for the strategy.</p>
						
						<p>For example, a investment management firm may decide to create a global equity strategy with a focus on the global stock market. From the range of available indices, they could choose the <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/msci-acwi.asp" target="_blank">MSCI All Country World Index</a> (ACWI) &mdash; a global stock market index that contains nearly 3,000 companies from around the world &mdash; as the investment universe for the strategy.</p>
						
						<p>The five largest stock holdings in the ACWI, which is based on the company's <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp" target="_blank">market capitalisation</a>, are shown in figure 1.</p>

						<p>Next, an important distinction is made: whether the strategy is <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activeinvesting.asp" target="_blank">active</a> or <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp" target="_blank">passive</a>.</p>
						
						<h3 id="passive-investment-strategies" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Passive investment strategies</h3>	
						
						<p>A <strong>passive strategy</strong> aims to replicate the portfolio of investments in the appropriate market index. If the global equity strategy from the previous example was created as a passive strategy, it would hold the same companies as the ACWI in exactly the same weights &mdash; or as closely as is practical (for logistical reasons, the smallest weighted holdings are sometimes excluded from strategies that replicate an index with a large number of total holdings).</p>
						
						<p>Importantly, market indexes are theoretical: they can't be invested in directly. Creating a passive strategy is a first step in making an index available for actual investment (the second is to launch an associated <a href="#investment-vehicles">investment vehicle</a>, which we will cover shortly).</p>

						<h3 id="active-investment-strategies" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Active investment strategies</h3>	
						
						<p>In contrast to passive strategies &mdash; which simply recreate a market index &mdash; the portfolio managers of an <strong>active strategy</strong> select a portion of investments from the index that they believe have the best long-term prospects.</p>
						
						<p>Typically, an active strategy will have a set of guidelines in place: the number of holdings to be held in the strategy portfolio, a maximum size of any single holding as a percentage of the total portfolio, requirements for individual holdings (a minimum company size for stocks, or credit rating for bonds), and so on.</p>
						
						<p>Working within the guidelines, portfolio managers use an <strong>investment process</strong> to select investments from the index to hold in the strategy portfolio (holdings may vary over time, as conditions change). The guidelines and investment process usually incorporates principles from the managing firm's overall <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-philosophy.asp" target="_blank">investment philosophy</a>.</p>
					
						<h3 id="performance-benchmarks" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Performance benchmarks</h3>	

						<p>For both active and passive strategies, the market index is used as a <strong>benchmark</strong> to periodically compare performance against: passive strategies attempt to match the index performance as closely as possible, whereas active strategies attempt to beat it.</p>

							</figcaption>
						</figure>						
											
						<p>Lewisham's strategies are all actively managed: the firm's portfolio managers build concentrated portfolios of investments, which they select using a value-orientated investment process (in line with the firm's <a href="business-overview.html#business-overview-for-lewisham-asset-management">overall investment philosophy</a>. For example, the Global Equity Strategy holds between 30 to 40 stocks in the strategy portolio, selected from roughly 3,000 available in the relevant market index.</p>
						
						<div class="p-4 mb-3 border position-relative">
							<p class="mb-0">Try to list all the investment strategies your firm offers, like figure 2. This information should be available internally (the RFP team are a good place to start), in regulatory documents, or within the capabilities or strategies section of the firm’s website.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2 id="investment-vehicles" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment vehicles</h2>	
						
						<p>Like a market index, an investment strategy is hypothetical, and cannot be invested in directly. To allow investment, there must be an associated <strong>investment vehicle</strong> available, to give investors something tangible to buy and sell.</p>
						
						<p>An investment vehicles allows an associated investment strategy to be "put into practice" &mdash; stocks, bonds, or other securities are selected according to the strategy, held within a vehicle, and actual investment results are delivered to those who invest in the vehicle.</p>
						
						<p>For our purposes, we can differentiate between two major types of investment vehicle: <strong>separately managed accounts (SMAs)</strong> and <strong>pooled investment funds</strong>.</p>
												
						<h3 id="pooled-investment-funds" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Pooled investment funds</h3>
						
						<p>A pooled investment fund is an investment vehicle in which money is pooled together from multiple investors to hold underlying investments (stocks, bonds, and so on) chosen by the fund's investment manager in accordance with an associated investment strategy. Investors can purchase units of the pooled fund to access the strategy. Examples of pooled funds include <strong>mutual funds</strong> and <strong>exchange traded funds (ETFs)</strong>.</p>
						
						<p>Pooled funds offer some options to investors through their share classes. Investors choose a share class from those made available by a pooled fund’s investment manager when making an investment. While all investors in a pooled fund – no matter which share class they choose – own the same underlying pool of investments, each share class will offer some form of customisation (such as a choice for the fee, income distributions, or currency). Detailed explanations of an investment manager’s available share classes are provided in their regulatory documents.</p>
						
						<h3 id="separately-managed-accounts" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Separately managed accounts (SMAs)</h3>

						<p>Investors with enough money to invest (an amount that is determined by each investment manager) can open their own account directly with an investment manager, who buys and sells underlying investments – according to the associated investment strategy – within the account. SMAs have some potential advantages to pooled investment funds: (1) the investor directly owns the underlying securities instead of just a share of the vehicle, (2) the investment strategy can be individually customised for each account, (3) there may be potential tax benefits for investors, (4) more detailed and regular reporting is available, and (5) fees charged by the investment manager are usually lower.</p>
						
						<h3 id="fees" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Fees</h3>
						
						<p>The primary source of revenue for investment managers comes from the <strong>fees</strong> they charge for managing investment vehicles. These are usually specified as a percentage of assets and periodically taken out from the capital within the vehicle (an additional performance fee is sometimes charged on profits but are not as common).</p>
						
						<p>Fees can vary quite widely across vehicles, strategies, and share classes, but generally, vehicles with lower fees come with a higher investment minimum requirement. Because fees are taken out of the vehicle’s capital, and not billed separately to investors, investment performance of the vehicle is reduced by the amount of the fee each time it is charged.</p>
						
						<h4 id="lewishams-fee-schedule" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham's fee schedule</h4>
						
						<p>Lewisham's fee schedule is shown in figure 3. Investors with over $1 million (or other currency equivalent) can buy the institutional share class of a mutual fund and access the same underlying investments as the investor share class &mdash; but for 0.25% less in fees. The firm has decided to charge the same fee for every fund, regardless of strategy. Investors with over $25 million can open a separately managed account to access even lower fees.</p>
