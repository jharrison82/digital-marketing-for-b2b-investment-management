						<p>In this chapter, we will research and document the range of <strong>investment strategies</strong>, associated <strong>investment vehicles</strong> (which make strategies available for investment), and any other <strong>services</strong> offered by your firm.<p>
						
						<h2 id="investment-strategies" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment strategies</h2>	
						
						<p>An investment strategy is simply an approach to investing in some area of the financial markets. Once an area of focus is chosen &mdash; such as the global stock market, U.S. stock market, or European bond market &mdash; an appropriate <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp" target="_blank">market index</a> is selected, which makes up the universe of available investments for the strategy.</p>
						
						<p>For example, a investment management firm may decide to create a global equity strategy that focuses on the global stock market. From the range of available market indices, they could choose the <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/msci-acwi.asp" target="_blank">MSCI All Country World Index</a> (ACWI) &mdash; a global stock market index that contains nearly 3,000 companies from around the world &mdash; as the investment universe for the strategy.</p>
						
						<p>The five largest stock holdings in the ACWI, which are weighted by the company's <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp" target="_blank">market capitalisation</a>, are shown in figure 1.</p>

						<p>Next, an important distinction is made: whether the strategy is <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activeinvesting.asp" target="_blank">active</a> or <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp" target="_blank">passive</a>.</p>
						
						<h3 id="passive-investment-strategies" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Passive investment strategies</h3>	
						
						<p>A <strong>passive strategy</strong> aims to replicate the portfolio of investments in the appropriate market index. If the global equity strategy from the previous example was created as a passive strategy, it would hold the same companies as the ACWI, in exactly the same weights &mdash; or as closely as is practical (the smallest weighted holdings are sometimes excluded from strategies that replicate an index with a large number of total holdings).</p>
						
						<p>Importantly, market indexes are theoretical: they can't be invested in directly. Creating a passive strategy is a first step in making an index available for actual investment (the second is to launch an associated <a href="#investment-vehicles">investment vehicle</a>, which we will cover shortly).</p>

						<h3 id="active-investment-strategies" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Active investment strategies</h3>	
						
						<p>In contrast to passive strategies &mdash; which simply recreate a market index &mdash; the portfolio managers of an <strong>active strategy</strong> select a portion of investments from the index that they believe have the best long-term prospects.</p>
						
						<p>Typically, an active strategy will have a set of guidelines in place: the number of holdings to be held in the strategy portfolio, a maximum size of any single holding as a percentage of the total portfolio, requirements for individual holdings (a minimum company size for stocks, or credit rating for bonds), and so on.</p>
						
						<p>Working within the guidelines, portfolio managers use an <strong>investment process</strong> to select investments from the index to hold in the strategy portfolio (holdings may vary over time, as conditions change). The guidelines and investment process usually incorporates principles from the managing firm's overall <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-philosophy.asp" target="_blank">investment philosophy</a>.</p>
					
						<h3 id="performance-benchmarks" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Performance benchmarks</h3>	

						<p>For both active and passive strategies, the market index is used as a <strong>benchmark</strong> to periodically compare performance against: passive strategies attempt to match the index performance as closely as possible, whereas active strategies attempt to beat it.</p>

						<p>Lewisham's strategies are all actively managed: the firm's portfolio managers build concentrated portfolios of investments, which they select using a value-orientated investment process (all in line with the firm's <a href="business-overview.html#business-overview-for-lewisham-asset-management">overall investment philosophy</a>). Their <strong>Global Equity Strategy</strong>, for example, holds between 30 to 40 stocks in the strategy portolio, selected from roughly 3,000 available in the relevant market index.</p>
						
						<div class="p-4 mb-3 border position-relative">
							<p class="mb-0">Try to list all the investment strategies your firm offers, in a similar format to figure 2. This information should be available internally (the RFP team are a good place to start), in regulatory documents, or within the capabilities or strategies section of the firm's website.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2 id="investment-vehicles" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment vehicles</h2>	
						
						<p>Like a market index, an investment strategy is hypothetical, and can't be invested in directly. To allow investment, there must be an associated <strong>investment vehicle</strong> available, which gives investors something tangible to buy and sell. The investment vehicle allows an investment strategy to be "put into practice" &mdash; stocks, bonds, or other securities are selected according to an associated strategy, held within a vehicle, and actual investment results are delivered to those who invest in the vehicle.</p>
												
						<p>Multiple investment vehicles can be associated with a single strategy, with each vehicle holding the same composition of underlying investments (although there may be some variation due to customised portfolios for specific investors or restrictions that apply to some types of vehicle). When changes are made to holdings within the strategy portfolio, these are usually applied across all investment vehicles associated with the strategy.</p>
												
						<p>For our purposes, we will differentiate between two major types of investment vehicle: <strong>pooled investment funds</strong> and <strong>separately managed accounts (SMAs)</strong>.</p>
						
						<h3 id="lewishams-investment-vehicles" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham's investment vehicles</h3>
						
						<p>Lewisham offer a range of investment vehicles &mdash; shown in figure 3 &mdash; which include separately managed accounts, three mutual funds for US-based investors, and three mutual funds for investors in a variety of countries within the European Union. Each vehicle is associated with one of the firm's investment strategies from figure 2.</p>

						<h3 id="pooled-investment-funds" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Pooled investment funds</h3>
						
						<p>A pooled investment fund is an investment vehicle in which money is pooled together from multiple investors to hold underlying investments (stocks, bonds, and so on), chosen by the fund's investment manager, in accordance with an associated investment strategy. Investors can purchase units of the pooled fund to access the associated strategy. Examples of pooled funds include <strong>mutual funds</strong> and <strong>exchange traded funds (ETFs)</strong>.</p>
												
						<p>Pooled investment funds can be launched for investors within a single country (such as the United States), and also &mdash; if they are built with a <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ucits.asp" target="_blank">UCITS</a> structure &mdash; can be marketed and sold in multiple countries, most commonly in the European Union.</p>
						
						<p>To launch UCITS funds, an investment manager must first set up a fund company that is domiciled in a country within the European Union (usually Luxembourg or Ireland, for infrastructure and tax reasons). Once in place, UCITS funds can be launched from within this corporate entity, with each fund known as a <strong>sub-fund</strong> of the fund company.</p>
						
						<h4 id="share-classes" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Share classes</h4>	
						
						<p>Pooled funds offer options to investors through their <strong>share classes</strong>. Investors choose a share class from those made available by a pooled fund's investment manager when making an investment. While all investors in a pooled fund &mdash; no matter which share class they choose &mdash; own the same underlying pool of investments, each share class will offer some form of customisation (a full explanation of an investment manager's share classes are provided in regulatory documents).</p>		
						
						<p>In the United States, the only distinction between mutual fund share classes is the amount of fees and expenses charged to investors, whereas UCITS share classes offer more options to investors &mdash; and also determine their availability by country.</p>
						
						<p>As mentioned previously, a UCITS sub-fund must be registered and approved by the regulator in the domiciled country of the fund company. Then &mdash; to make a sub-fund available for investment &mdash; at least one share class must be created. Each share class must also be registered and approved in the domiciled country, where it can then be sold. From this point, the UCITS framework allows approved share classes to be freely registered for sale in any other country within the European Union (called <strong>passporting</strong>). UCITS funds and share classes can also be registered for sale in countries outside the European Union, but the normal application process must be followed (i.e., no passporting is allowed).</p>
						
						<p>As the availability of UCITS funds to investors in a specific country is determined at the share class level, a document is usually maintained by the investment manager's operations team that records the countries in which each share class is registered (a very helpful resource to ensure UCITS fund-related marketing activity is targeted correctly).</p>
						
						<p>The options that UCITS share classes can offer to investors include &mdash; in addition to various fee levels &mdash; a choice for (1) how dividends or interest payments received from investments in the fund are distributed to investors, (2) the currency of the share class <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp" target="_blank">net-asset-value</a> (NAV), and (3) whether the investment manager attempts to minimise the impact of foreign exchange movements on investment returns, where relevant.</p>

						<p>Each UCITS share class typically incorporates a combination of options, but it's unlikely that an investment manager will offer all possible combinations of share class options, and there are no rules that dictate if any UCITS share classes must be made available as a minimum. Therefore, we can assume the decision of which share classes to offer is left to investment managers, who will likely create them in expectation of client demand (for example, in popular currencies) or when they have been specifically requested (a potential client may request a new share class with a specific set of options). Conversely &mdash; as share classes have ongoing running costs &mdash; those with low interest or a low amount of invested capital may be closed by the investment manager. Some investment managers offer 20+ share classes per UCITS fund, so the launching and closing process can happen regularly.</p>
						
						<h4 id="lewishams-pooled-investment-funds" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham's pooled investment funds</h4>	
						
						<p>For their pooled innvestment fund offering, Lewisham have launched a series of mutual funds for investors, grouped into two fund ranges: one for US-based investors, and another for investors located within a variety of countries in the European Union (depending on the country registration status of each share class).</p>
						
						<p>Their US mutual funds, along with available share classes, are shown in figure 4. The only difference between share classes are fees and minimum investment amounts (which are set out in the firm's fee schedule in figure 8).</p>

						</figure>

						<p>Using this naming convention &mdash; and referring back to figure 5 &mdash; we can determine which options apply to a share class from its name. For example, we can deduce that the share class <strong>Lewisham Global Equity UCITS Fund - INST Acc USD</strong> is (1) a share class of the Lewisham Global Equity UCITS sub-fund, (2) has the "institutional" fee from the schedule in figure X, (3) keeps dividends and interest payments within the fund, (4) has a NAV priced in US Dollars, and (5) doesn't attempt to minimise currency risks.</p>
						
						<p>Lewisham's available share classes for their UCITS funds, along with the countries in which they have been registered for sale, are shown in figure 7.</p>

							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						
						<p>As Lewisham have domiciled their fund company in Luxembourg, all their UCITS share classes have initially been registered in Luxembourg, before being passported to other European Union countries, as needed. It also means that the share class <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isin.asp" target="_blank">ISINs</a> (International Securities Identification Numbers) listed in figure 7 &mdash; which serve as a unique identifier, and are often used to search for share classes online &mdash; all begin with "LU", as the first two letters of an ISIN indicate which country the fund company is domiciled in.</p>
						
						<p>Importantly, although share classes can't be marketed to investors in countries where they aren't registered, professional investors can invest in any UCITS share class they wish &mdash; even if it is not registered in their country and they are in a country outside the European Union. This means you might sometimes see countries outside those that a share class is registered in for breakdowns of AUM by investor country &mdash; but it won't affect marketing efforts.</p>
						
						<h4 id="share-class-currencies-and-currency-hedging" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Share class currencies and currency hedging</h4>
						
						<p>We can also look at Lewisham's available share classes to help us understand how currency and hedging options can work in practice. Let's use the <strong>Lewisham US Equity UCITS Fund</strong>, which holds underlying investments &mdash; the stocks of US companies &mdash; that are priced in US Dollars (USD). The fund's base currency is also set to USD (if all a sub-fund's underlying investments are within a single country, the sub-fund's base currency will typically match the currency of the underlying investments).</p>
						
						<p>The fund's net asset value (NAV) is calculated once per day, in the base currency, by dividing the total value of the investments held in the fund by the number of fund units. Dividing holdings valued at $100m by 10 million fund units would give a daily NAV of $10.00: investors can purchase or sell a unit of the fund at this price on that day. The NAV may rise or fall the next day; if the fund's investments increase in value at $102 million, and the number of units stay the same, the NAV would become $10.20 (a return of +2.00%).</p>
						
						<p>The first share class launched for the Lewisham US Equity UCITS Fund was denominated in USD, the same as the fund's base currency. However, UCITS funds are aimed primarily at investors in the European Union, who will have a different local currency &mdash; Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Swiss Franc (CHF), and so on. This means that at some point, a currency exchange must occur between the USD share class and the investor's local currency (possibly made by a broker that handled the transaction, who may set a disadvantageous rate for the investor). For example, a UK-based investor's holdings in the Lewisham US Equity UCITS Fund's USD share class must at some point be converted to GBP.</p>
						
						<p>Investment managers can make it more convenient for investors by offering share classes priced in their local currency (and presumably, they also use a better exchange rate for investors than brokers). Investment performance is also calculated in the relevant currency. Lewisham offer a share class for the US Equity UCITS Fund for UK investors, with its NAV priced in GBP. Roughly speaking, if the USD NAV is $10.00, and the USD/GBP exchange rate is 0.82, the GBP NAV would be roughly £8.20.</p>
						
						<p>To further complicate matters, currency exchange rates change over time. Therefore, the investment performance of the GBP share class will deviate from the USD share class &mdash; even though they share the same underlying fund investments. For example, if the investments held by the Lewisham US Equity UCITS Fund rise in value by 2.00%, the USD NAV would rise by the same amount &mdash; as the investments are also priced in USD. However, performance of the GBP share class is also affected by changes in the USD/GBP exchange rate. If, during the same period, the USD/GBP rate moved from 0.82 to 0.81 (the GBP weakens in value by 1.22% against the USD) investors in the GBP share class investors would receive a lower return of around 0.76%.</p>
						
						<p>As shown in figure 8, the return of a share class can be split into two components: (1) fund performance in the base currency (e.g., USD), and (2) the change in value of the share class currency versus the fund's base currency, if they are different (e.g., USD/GBP).</p>

						</figure>
						
						<p>For investors who are uncomfortable with the currency risk, some investment managers offer <strong>currency hedged</strong> share classes, in which the fund managers attempt to remove the impact of exchange rate changes on the share class return &mdash; usually via <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyforward.asp" target="_blank">currency forward contracts</a>. Investors buy and sell the share class in their local currency, but only receive the fund return component in the base currency (essentially, the return of the underlying investments). Note, however, that currency hedging is imperfect &mdash; it can't remove 100% of the currency risk &mdash; so investment performance of a hedged share class will still be slightly affected by exchange rate changes.</p>
						
						<p>Lewisham offer a GBP-hedged share class to UK-based investors for the Lewisham US Equity UCITS Fund which, although priced in GBP, attempts to remove the effect of changes between USD/GBP, so that the share class return matches the return of the underlying investments in their base currency (as closely as possible).</p>					
												
						<p>Note that more complex examples exist than those we've covered &mdash; for example, funds can hold investments priced in multiple currencies, other types of currency hedging are attempted, and so on &mdash; but they are out of scope for this guide.</p>
						
						<h3 id="separately-managed-accounts" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Separately managed accounts (SMAs)</h3>

						<p>Investors with enough money to invest (an amount determined by each individual investment manager) can open their own account directly with an investment manager, who buys and sells underlying investments &mdash; according to the associated investment strategy &mdash; within the account.</p>

						<p>Separately managed accounts have some potential advantages when compared to pooled investment funds:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Direct ownership of underlying investments</strong>. With pooled investment funds, investors own a share of the investment vehicle, which in turn owns the underlying investments. With an SMA, the investor directly owns the underlying securities.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Customisation</strong>. Unlike pooled investment funds, which can't be customised beyond the existing share class options, the associated strategy for a separately managed account can be individually customised for each account.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Tax benefits</strong>. As the underlying investments are directly owned by the investor, there may be potential tax benefits via <a class="exeternal" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp" target="_blank">tax-loss harvesting</a> strategies</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Transparency</strong>. More comprehensive and regular reporting for all underlying investments in the portfolio is made available.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Negotiable fees</strong>. Fees charged by the investment manager can be negotiated by the investor, and may sometimes be lower than actively managed mutual funds.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h4 id="lewishams-separately-managed-accounts" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham's separately managed accounts</h4>
						
						<p>Investors can open a separately managed account with the firm, using any of the firm's investment strategies as a starting point, which can then be customised for each individual account. The firm has set a minimum investment amount of $25 million, and a negotiable fee of 0.50%, in their fee schedule shown in figure 9. There are no restrictions on the country of the investor.</p>
						
						<h3 id="fees" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Fees</h3>
						
						<p>The primary source of revenue for investment managers comes from the <strong>fees</strong> they charge for managing investment vehicles. These are usually specified as a percentage of assets and periodically taken out from the capital within the vehicle (an additional performance fee is sometimes charged on profits but are not as common).</p>
						
						<p>Fees can vary quite widely across vehicles, strategies, and share classes, but generally, vehicles with lower fees come with a higher investment minimum requirement. Because fees are taken out of the vehicle's capital, and not billed separately to investors, investment performance of the vehicle is reduced by the amount of the fee each time it is charged.</p>
						
						<h4 id="lewishams-fee-schedule" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham's fee schedule</h4>
						
						<p>Lewisham's fee schedule is shown in figure 3. Investors with over $1 million (or other currency equivalent) can buy the institutional share class of a mutual fund and access the same underlying investments as the investor share class &mdash; but for 0.25% less in fees (the firm has decided to charge the same fee for every fund, regardless of strategy). Investors with over $25 million can open a separately managed account to access even lower fees.</p>
