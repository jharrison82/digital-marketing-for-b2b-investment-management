				<p>The next step is to list all investment strategies your firm offers, globally. This information should be available internally (the RFP team are a good place to start), in regulatory documents, or within the capabilities or strategies section of the firm’s website.</p>
				
				<p>Lewisham’s range of investment strategies are shown in Figure 5.1.</p>

				<p>At this point, you may be unsure what an investment strategy is. It is simply an approach to investing in some area of the financial markets. As an example, the portfolio managers of Lewisham’s Global Equity strategy (shown in figure 5.1) have an initial universe of all the companies within a global stock market index to choose from – the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/msci-acwi.asp" target="_blank">MSCI All Country World Index</a> (ACWI) – which contains nearly 3,000 companies from around the world.</p>
				
				<p>At this point, we can differentiate between two main types of investment strategy. <strong>Passive strategies</strong> aim to recreate an index portfolio as closely as possible (a passive strategy is the first step towards making an index investable) whereas <strong>active strategies</strong> only select a portion of investments from the relevant index. For example, a passive strategy based on the MSCI ACWI will hold the same 3,000 companies in the same weights as the index (as closely as is practical), whereas an active strategy (such as Lewisham’s Global Equity strategy) will hold a more concentrated portfolio of companies the managers believe have the best long-term prospects.</p>			
				
				<p>An active investment strategy will usually have a set of guidelines in place, which may include: (1) the typical number of holdings in the strategy portfolio, (2) maximum size of any single holding as a percentage of the total portfolio, or (3) requirements for individual holdings (a minimum company size for stocks, or credit rating for bonds, etc). Working within these guidelines, portfolio managers apply an investment process that was devised for the strategy. This process determines which investments are selected from the index to hold in the strategy portfolio (which may vary over time, as conditions change).</p>
