					<p>Ultimately, a common goal of all investment managers is to grow their <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" target="_blank">assets under management (AUM)</a> over time. Generating sales (inflows) of the <a href="6-investment-vehicles.html">firm's products</a> and preventing redemptions (outflows) of money already invested &mdash; alongside any rise in the prices of underlying investments &mdash; contributes to the firm's AUM growth.</p>
					
					<h2 id="marketing-attribution-for-product-flows" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing attribution for product flows</h2>
					
					<p>With the AUM growth goal in mind &mdash; alongside a huge increase in the availability of data and focus on marketing as a business cost &mdash; marketing teams are now increasingly attempting to measure and attribute flows into investment products which have been entirely sourced from, or influenced by, marketing activity.</p>  
					
					<p>However, within <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong> investment management, trades in or out of a firm's products are not made online &mdash; website visitors can't open an investment account or invest in products directly through the firm's website. Trades are either handled by the sales team or conducted entirely through a third-party investment platform, which means that transaction and holdings data often isn't available. This problem alone makes it almost impossible to attribute marketing activity to product flows, regardless of any potential further complications.</p>
															
					<p>Because of this complexity, we won't be trying to credit the marketing team's involvement in specific inflows of money.</p>
										
					<h2 id="smart-goals-and-objectives" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">SMART goals and objectives</h2>
									
					<p>There still remains a general consensus that <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank">SMART goals and objectives</a> must be set for a strategy. Should we create some digitally-focused goals and objectives &mdash; based on website visits, leads generated, bounce rates, email opens, and so on &mdash; that the team's performance can be measured against?</p>
					
					<p>Personally, my answer is no &mdash; we are better off without them. To understand why, let's assume we have an objective to increase website visits by 100% versus the previous year. I would have several questions for the person who set it:</p>
												
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>What was the rationale for choosing the specific number?</strong> Usually, there wasn't any.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>Can it account for quality?</strong> For example, we might publish more specialised content for our target audience that attracts a lower volume of website traffic, but which is a better fit for our firm. According to our objective, we have failed, as it can’t take this simple nuance into account.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>If, at the end of next year, we haven't met an objective (or exceeded it), what would we do about it?</strong> The answer is the same for both outcomes: nothing. Our objectives aren't actionable.</li>
						<li><strong>If we doubled the desired increase to 200%, would that change anything about our approach?</strong> Apart from simply spending more on advertising (a rather blunt tactic), our output wouldn’t change based on the size of the value we choose for our objective. </li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Therefore, we won't be setting SMART goals and objectives.</p> 
					
					<p>I suspect that no SMART goals or objectives will have been set at your firm anyway, and the only analytics reporting will be a few neglected website reports and an occasional presentation of the outcome of a marketing campaign via a Powerpoint presentation containing numbers without context ("...we had 32,455 page views"). Sometimes an over-enthusiastic team may have tried to set up a regular "analytics meeting" &mdash; with the next meeting topic always "to be confirmed" &mdash; but these inevitably become a chore, and are eventually abandoned.</p>

					<p>I should point out here that outside of the B2B investment management industry, there are places where SMART goals and objectives do make sense (as long as sufficient technology resources are available). For example, if a firm has a specific website conversion objective that is directly linked to revenue &mdash; such as applications for a credit card &mdash; the conversion rate can be monitored and optimised over time by analysing large amounts of data and using it to make small, incremental changes to the website (for the credit card company, the conversion rate would be the number of completed applications as a percentage of website visits). However, typical website journeys on B2B investment manager's websites are short and involve simple searches for information, with transactions dealt with elsewhere &mdash; there isn’t much to optimise.</p>
					
					<p>We will still make <strong>key performance information (KPI)</strong> data available to curious colleagues through a series of self-serve reports, but even this can be a challenge &mdash; KPI data is often spread across multiple systems, and the technological capabilities often aren't available to pull it together to make it easier to report on them.</p>
																																	
					<h2 id="goals-and-principles" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Goals and principles</h2>
					
					<p>So, what should we use in the place of SMART goal and objectives? My suggestion is a single goal &mdash; <strong>support the growth of firm AUM over the long-term</strong> &mdash; alongside a couple of guiding principles, which should apply at almost every B2B investment manager:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-3">We don't need arbitrary targets to give us purpose, or "something to work towards". Instead, we should develop and maintain an intrinsic desire to produce useful and high-quality content for our target audience, and only distribute content to those who have explicitly asked to receive it.</li>
						<li>Always maintain a focus on supporting the sales team, as they are ones that ultimately "make the sale". Listen to their feedback. This will include making sure we make the core product marketing materials available, making them easly accessible, providing regular content to use with their clients and prospects, listen to what their clients are asking for, and providing them with information on what their clients and prospects are doing. Encourage digital activity of clients and prosects within the maketing database that can be fed back to the sales team.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Sticking with these principles should improve the marketing team's reputation with the sales team &mdash; and, more importantly, the firm's reputation with clients and prospects &mdash; over the long-term.</p>
