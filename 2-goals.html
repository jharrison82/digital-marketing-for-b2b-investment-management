					<p>Ultimately, a common goal of all investment managers is to grow their <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" target="_blank">assets under management (AUM)</a> over time. Generating sales (inflows) of the <a href="6-investment-vehicles.html">firm's products</a> and preventing redemptions (outflows) of money already invested &mdash; alongside any rise in the prices of underlying investments &mdash; contributes to the firm's AUM growth.</p>
					
					<h2 id="marketing-attribution-for-product-flows" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing attribution for product flows</h2>
					
					<p>With the AUM growth goal in mind &mdash; alongside a huge increase in the availability of data and focus on marketing as a business cost &mdash; marketing teams are increasingly attempting to measure and attribute flows into investment products which have been entirely sourced from, or influenced by, marketing activity.</p>  
					
					<p>However, within <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong> investment management, trades in or out of a firm's products are not carried out online &mdash; website visitors can't open an investment account or invest in products directly through the firm's website. Instead, trades are either handled by the sales team or conducted entirely through a third-party investment platform, which means that transaction and holdings data often isn't available. This problem alone makes it almost impossible to attribute marketing activity to specific trades of the firm's products.</p>
															
					<p>Because of this complexity, we won't be trying to credit the marketing team's involvement in specific inflows of money.</p>
										
					<h2 id="smart-goals-and-objectives" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">SMART goals and objectives</h2>
									
					<p>There still remains a general consensus that SMART goals and objectives should be set for a strategy. Should we create some digitally-focused goals and objectives &mdash; based on website visits, leads generated, bounce rates, email opens, and so on &mdash; that the team can be measured on? Personally, my answer is no. I think we are better off without them.</p>
					
					<p>To understand why, let's assume we have an objective to increase website visits by 100% versus the previous year. I would have some questions for the person who set it:</p>
												
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>What was the rationale for choosing the specific number?</strong> Usually, there wasn't any.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>Can it account for quality?</strong> For example, we might publish more specialised content for our target audience that attracts a lower volume of website traffic, but which is a better fit for our firm. According to our objective, we have failed, as it can’t take this simple nuance into account.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>If, at the end of next year, we haven't met an objective (or exceeded it), what would we do about it?</strong> The answer is the same for both outcomes: nothing. Our objectives aren't actionable.</li>
						<li><strong>If we doubled the desired increase to 200%, would that change anything about our approach?</strong> Apart from simply spending more on advertising (a rather blunt tactic), our output wouldn’t change based on the size of the value we choose for our objective. </li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In short, I don't believe SMART goals and objectives are useful for us, so we won't be using them. If this view is challenged by a colleague or manager &mdash; who may have a vague sense that they need lots of data and analytics review meetings &mdash; you can question what they currently have in place. Most likely, you will find that no SMART goals or objectives will actually have been set. Instead, the outcome of a marketing campaign will occasionally be presented via a Powerpoint presentation containing numbers with no context or actual use (e.g., "...we had 32,455 page views"). Over-enthusiastic teams sometimes initiate a regular "analytics meeting" (where topics are always to be set in the future) but they inevitablly become a chore and are eventually abandoned.</p>

					<p>Even where SMART goals and objectives have been set, it can be a challenge to properly measure, absorb and utilise the source data. The technological capabilities often aren't available to pull data from different systems together to make it easier to monitor and report on them. Data about leads generated isn't usually captured in the same place as website visits, for example.</p>
					
					<p>In the case where transactions that directly link to revenue take place entirely on a firm's website, and there are sufficient resources and technology available, it does make sense to use SMART objectives and goals. For example, with a very specific website conversion goal &mdash; such as applications for a credit card &mdash; the conversion rate can be monitored and optimised over time by analysing large amounts of data and using it to make small, incremental changes to the website (for a credit card company, the conversion rate would be the number of completed applications as a percentage of website visits). However, typical website journeys on B2B investment manager's websites are short and involve simple searches for information, with transactions dealt with elsewhere &mdash; there isn’t much to optimise.</p>
																																	
					<h2 id="a-single-goal" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">A single goal</h2>
					
					<p>With the understanding, then, that SMART goals or objectives aren’t in fact necessary or useful, we shall put them aside. Instead, we will stay focused on a single goal – to support the growth of firm AUM over the long-term (the same for any investment management firm) – and build a digital marketing infrastructure that will serve as a guardrail to keep the team on track. All new projects will be carefully considered before being undertaken to make sure they (1) align with our goal, (2) can be incorporated into the existing infrastructure, and (3) meet quality control requirements. Time savings from cutting out unnecessary work will free up the team to spend more time in this area.</p>
					
					<p>Content we publish shouldn’t be driven by arbitrary targets, but by an intrinsic desire to provide value to our target audience.</p>

					<p>Curious colleagues – or those needing inspiration, such as content writers – will be provided with a suite of self-service reports to monitor key performance indicators.</p>
					
					<p>At the core of the <a href="3-strategy.html">digital marketing strategy</a> is the firm's marketing automation database, which we will attempt to grow over time with a mix of new leads and existing clients. The digital activity of individuals within the marketing automation database can be tracked at an individual level (such as an identified contact's website visits, email engagement, downloads, and form submissions). This information can then be fed to salespeople to help them create new relationships and support their ongoing prospecting and client servicing efforts.</p>
					
					<p>Underpinning this is the involvement of the digital marketing team in the production and distribution of marketing content, both to salespeople – for use with their clients and prospects – and directly to the firm's audiences. In addition to arming the sales team with valuable resources, it will help the marketing team generate new leads and encourage digital activity of clients and prosects within the maketing database that can be fed back to the sales team.</p>
