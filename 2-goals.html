					<p>Ultimately, a common goal of all investment managers is to grow their <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" target="_blank">assets under management (AUM)</a> over the long-term. Generating sales (<strong>inflows</strong>) of the <a href="6-investment-vehicles.html">firm's products</a> and preventing redemptions (<strong>outflows</strong>) of money already invested &mdash; alongside any overall rise in the prices of underlying investments &mdash; contributes to the firm's AUM growth.</p>
					
					<h2 id="marketing-attribution-for-product-flows" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing attribution for product flows</h2>
					
					<p>With an increase in the availability of data and focus on marketing as a business cost, marketing teams are increasingly trying to measure flows into their firm's investment products that have been sourced from, or influenced by, marketing activity.</p>  
					
					<p>However, within <a href="/digital-marketing-for-b2b-investment-management/#what-is-b2b-investment-management">business-to-business (B2B) investment management</a>, trades in or out of a firm's investment products are not made online &mdash; website visitors can't simply open an investment account or invest in products directly through the firm's website. Trades are either handled by the sales team or conducted entirely through a third-party investment platform, which means that transaction and holdings data often isn't available. This makes it essentially impossible to attribute flows to marketing activity &mdash; even before any challenges with the attribution itself would need to be considered.</p>
															
					<p>Therefore, we won't be trying to attribute product flows to marketing activity.</p>
										
					<h2 id="smart-objectives" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">SMART objectives</h2>
									
					<p>There seems to be a general consensus that <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank">SMART objectives</a> should be set for a digital marketing strategy to provide direction. Based on this advice, should we create some objectives that we can compare the team's performance against (website visits, leads generated, bounce rates, email opens, and so on)?</p>
					
					<p>My answer is no, for several reasons. The first is due to several important flaws with the objectives themselves. To help explain these, let's assume we have a simple objective: to increase annual website visits by 100% versus the previous year. I would have several questions for the person who came up with this objective:</p>
												
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>What was the rationale for choosing the specific number?</strong> Usually, there wasn't any, and it was chosen arbitrarily.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>Can it account for quality?</strong> We may decide to publish more specialised website content which attracts a lower volume of website traffic that contains visitors who are more in-line with the firm's ideal target audience. According to our objective, we have failed, as it can’t take this simple nuance into account.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>If, at the end of next year, we haven't met the objective (or exceeded it), what would we do about it?</strong> The answer is the same for both outcomes: nothing. Our objectives aren't actionable.</li>
						<li><strong>If we doubled the desired increase to 200%, would that change anything about our approach?</strong> Apart from simply spending more on advertising (a rather blunt tactic), our output wouldn't change based on the size of the value we choose for our objective. </li>
					</ul>

					<p>Another issue is getting the <strong>key performance indicator (KPI)</strong> data we need to measure the objectives, which can be surprisingly challenging. Data often sits across different systems (such as Google Analytics for the website, or the marketing automation system for email and leads) and teams often lack the technological capabilities to pull them all together in one place to make automated reporting possible.</p>

					<p>Finally, SMART objectives are very difficult to adopt in practice, and I suspect that almost no teams actually use them. Marketers either don't know they exist, or  &mdash; when they created some &mdash; have found it very difficult to fit them into their team's working schedule: a colleague sometimes discovers the joys of SMART objectives and, believing that every other team is using them, hastily creates their own and starts a regular review meeting. Quickly, however, these inevitably become a dreaded chore, and are eventually abandoned. Instead, analytics reporting usually ends up as a few neglected website reports and an occasional presentation of the outcome of a marketing campaign (usually via a Powerpoint presentation of numbers without context). </p>

					<p>Due to these issues &mdash; their inbuilt flaws, challenges with getting the KPI data, and the difficulty in using them &mdash; we won't be setting SMART objectives.</p>

					<p>As a brief aside, I should point out that there are places where SMART goals and objectives do make sense, which is usually outside the B2B investment management industry. A firm with a specific website conversion objective that is directly linked to revenue &mdash; such as applications for a credit card &mdash; can monitor and optimise the conversion rate over time by analysing large amounts of data and using it to make small, incremental changes to the website (for the credit card company, the conversion rate would be the number of completed applications as a percentage of website visits). However, typical website journeys on B2B investment manager's websites are short and involve simple searches for information, with transactions dealt with elsewhere &mdash; there isn’t much to optimise.</p>
																																						
					<h2 id="goals-and-principles" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Goals and principles</h2>
					
					<p>So, in the place of SMART objectives, what should be used instead?</p>
					
					<p>My suggestion is to not spend much time worrying about it. We can set a single, non-target based goal &mdash; <strong>support the growth of firm AUM over the long-term</strong> &mdash; and some guiding principles:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-3">Produce high-quality and useful content for the firm's target audience, in an appropriate format, to help establish it as a thought leader (regardless of how well that content is expected to "perform").</li>
						<li class="mb-3">Maintain an organic and transparent relationship with the firm's audiences with all marketing communications: allow people to choose what they want to receive, generate leads via a genuine exchange of value, and only distribute content to those who have explicitly asked to receive it (essentially, using <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permission_marketing" target="_blank">permission</a>, rather than <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interruption_marketing" target="_blank">interuption</a>, marketing tactics).</li>
						<li>Provide the best possible support to the sales team so they can create and maintain relationships with clients and prospects: providing the materials they need, listening to their feedback, and providing information on what their clients and prospects are engaging with digitally.</li>
					</ul>
												
					<p>Over time, we want to develop and nurture more straightforward, honest, and transparent relationships with the firm's clients and prospects based on a genuine exchange of value and more thoughtful, patient, and considered marketing efforts. Communications with clients and prospects will be more organic, transparent, and &mdash; frankly &mdash; less annoying than the typical efforts we see today.</p>
					
					<p>This means we will need to eliminate much of current standard practice in the industry today: constant self-promotion, sending content to audiences who haven't asked for it, cherry-picking performance numbers, sending product emails out of the blue, and spamming visitors who give their contact details to download gated content. In most cases, paid advertising &mdash; often ineffective, cumbersome, annoying, and expensive &mdash; will be a last resort. Instead, we will focus on more effective (and free) digital marketing channels.</p>
					
					<p>For any curious colleagues and managers who have questions (which usually come in randomly and are quickly forgotten), we will make KPI data available through a series of self-serve reports. However, we will not be beholden to any regular reviews.</p>

					<p>Consistently following the principles, relevant for almost every B2B investment manager, should make your colleagues happier, improve the marketing team's relationship with the sales team, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; improve the firm's reputation and credibility with clients and prospects over the long-term.</p>
