					<p>Ultimately, a common goal of all investment managers is to grow their <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" target="_blank">assets under management (AUM)</a> over time. Generating sales (inflows) of the <a href="6-investment-vehicles.html">firm's products</a> and preventing redemptions (outflows) of money already invested &mdash; alongside any rise in the prices of underlying investments &mdash; contributes to the firm's AUM growth.</p>
					
					<h2 id="marketing-attribution-for-product-flows" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing attribution for product flows</h2>
					
					<p>With this overall goal in mind, alongside a huge increase in availability of data, marketing teams at investment managers are increasingly attempting to measure and attribute flows into products which have been entirely sourced from, or influenced by, marketing activity.</p>  
					
					<p>However, within <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong> investment management, trades in or out of a firm's products are not carried out online &mdash; website visitors can't open an investment account or invest in products directly through the firm's website. Instead, trades are either handled by the sales team or conducted entirely through a third-party investment platform. This means that transaction and holdings data isn't consistently available, which makes it almost impossible to attribute marketing activity to specific trades of the firm's products.</p>
					
					<p>In theory, marketers at business-to-consumer (B2C) investment managers should be able to use data from transactions made through the firm's website for marketing attribution, but I suspect that even in this scenario, that is still incredibly difficult.</p>
										
					<p>Because of this complexity, we won't try to credit the marketing team's involvement in specific inflows of money as a goal.</p>
										
					<h2 id="smart-goals-and-objectives" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">SMART goals and objectives</h2>
									
					<p>Having put marketing attribution aside, there is still a general consensus that SMART goals and objectives should be set for a strategy. Should we create a set of digitally-focused goals and objectives &mdash; website visitors, leads generated, bounce rates, email opens, and so on? Personally, my answer is no. I think we are better off without them.</p>
					
					<p>To understand why, let's assume we have an objective to increase website visits by 100% versus the previous year. I would have several questions for the person who set it:</p>
												
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>What was the rationale for choosing the specific number?</strong> Usually, there wasn't any.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>Can it account for quality?</strong> For example, we might publish more specialised content for our target audience that attracts a lower volume of website traffic, but which is a better fit for our firm. According to our objective, we have failed, as it can’t take this simple nuance into account.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>If, at the end of next year, we haven't met an objective (or exceeded it), what would we do about it?</strong> The answer is the same for both outcomes: nothing. Our objectives aren't actionable.</li>
						<li><strong>If we doubled the desired increase to 200%, would that change anything about our approach?</strong> Apart from simply spending more on advertising (a rather blunt tactic), our output wouldn’t change based on the size of the value we choose for our objective. </li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>It does make sense, where transactions that directly link to revenue take place entirely on the website, for a business to use SMART objectives and goals. For example, with a very specific website conversion goal &mdash; such as applications for a credit card &mdash; a dedicated team can optimise the conversion rate over time by analysing large amounts of data and using it to make small, incremental changes to the website (for the credit card example, the conversion rate would be the number of completed applications as a percentage of website visits). However, typical website journeys on B2B websites are short and involve simple searches for information, with transactions dealt with elsewhere &mdash; there isn’t much to optimise.</p>
					
					<p>Additionally, it's also incredbily difficult to measure, absorb and utilise KPI data, especially for smaller marketing teams that lack significant resources (usually the case in investment management). For example, KPI data if often not available in a single location – data on the number of leads generated isn't usually captured in the same place as website visits, for example – and the technological capabilities aren't available to pull them all together to make it easier to monitor and report on them.</p>
					
					<p>Simply put, SMART goals and objectives simply don't work for the B2B industry. If you are challenged in this by a colleagure or manager, ask them when the last time they actually used KPIs was. Teams think they need analytics meetings and the numbers, they are inevitably abandoned over time. We won’t bother with them. Curious colleagues – or those needing inspiration, such as content writers – will be provided with a suite of self-service reports to monitor key performance indicators.</p>
										
					<p>As a final (and slightly ironic) point on the matter, most digital marketing teams at investment management firms don’t set or review SMART goals or objectives – as I would recommend – but not because any time was spent considering their utility and coming to the same conclusions, but because no thought was given to them at all. As the saying goes, a stopped clock is still right twice a day!</p>
					
					<p>We shall dispense with SMART goals and objectives. 
					
					
					<h2 id="what-will-be-our-general-approach" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">What will be our general approach?</h2>
					
					<p>Content we publish shouldn’t be driven by arbitrary targets, but by an intrinsic desire to provide value to our target audience.</p>
					
					<p>At the core of the <a href="3-strategy.html">digital marketing strategy</a> is the firm's marketing automation database, which we will attempt to grow over time with a mix of new leads and existing clients. The digital activity of individuals within the marketing automation database can be tracked at an individual level (such as an identified contact's website visits, email engagement, downloads, and form submissions). This information can then be fed to salespeople to help them create new relationships and support their ongoing prospecting and client servicing efforts.</p>
					
					<p>Underpinning this is the involvement of the digital marketing team in the production and distribution of marketing content, both to salespeople – for use with their clients and prospects – and directly to the firm's audiences. In addition to arming the sales team with valuable resources, it will help the marketing team generate new leads and encourage digital activity of clients and prosects within the maketing database that can be fed back to the sales team.</p>
					
					<h2 id="goal" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">A single goal</h2>
					
					<p>With the understanding, then, that SMART goals or objectives aren’t in fact necessary or useful, we shall put them aside. Instead, we will stay focused on a single goal – to support the growth of firm AUM over the long-term (the same for any investment management firm) – and build a digital marketing infrastructure that will serve as a guardrail to keep the team on track. All new projects will be carefully considered before being undertaken to make sure they (1) align with our goal, (2) can be incorporated into the existing infrastructure, and (3) meet quality control requirements. Time savings from cutting out unnecessary work will free up the team to spend more time in this area.</p>
