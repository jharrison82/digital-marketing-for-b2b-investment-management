				<p>Ultimately, a common goal of all investment managers is to grow their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" target="_blank">assets under management (AUM)</a> over time. Generating sales (inflows) of the firm’s products and preventing redemptions (outflows) of money already invested – alongside any rise in the prices of existing investments – contributes to the firm’s AUM growth.</p>
				
				<p>In the business-to-business (B2B) world – in contrast to business-to-consumer (B2C), where marketing can go directly to the end investor – the "heavy lifting" is the responsibility of the sales team. Visitors to a B2B investment management firm's website don't open investment accounts or invest in funds online. Instead, the firm’s sales teams maintain long-term relationships with investment professionals at other businesses and are responsible for generating sales of the firm's products.</p>
				
				<p>Any trades in or out of the firm's products are either handled directly by the sales team or conducted entirely through a third-party investment platform (for example, a financial advisor may use a platform that offers a range of funds, selected from various investment managers, to invest their clients' money). As transaction and holdings data isn't consistently available, it is very difficult – I would say almost impossible – to attribute marketing activity to specific buy and sell orders of the firm's products (despite this, I've seen it attempted a lot, with little success).</p>
				
				<p>Therefore, we will focus our digital marketing efforts on a more general level of support for the sales team, unconcerned with any attempt to credit the marketing team's involvement in specific inflows of money.</p>
				
				<p>At the core of the strategy is the firm's marketing automation database, which we will attempt to grow over time with a mix of new leads and existing clients. The digital activity of individuals within the marketing automation database can be tracked at an individual level (such as an identified contact's website visits, email engagement, downloads, and form submissions). This information can then be fed to salespeople to help them create new relationships and support their ongoing prospecting and client servicing efforts.</p>
				
				<p>Underpinning this is the involvement of the digital marketing team in the production and distribution of marketing content, both to salespeople – for use with their clients and prospects – and directly to the firm's audiences. In addition to arming the sales team with valuable resources, it encourages digital activity of clients and prosects that can be fed back to the sales team.</p>
				
				<h2 id="smart-goals-and-objectives" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">SMART goals and objectives</h2>
								
				<p>Common wisdom in marketing dictates that SMART goals and objectives should be set as part of a strategy. However, after spending many hours trying to make sense of them and understand how they can be incorporated into our day-to-day activities, I have concluded that we are better off without them.</p>
				
				<p>To understand why, let's choose some examples of key performance indicators we might use (website visits, bounce rate, and leads generated) and attach each one to an objective:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Increase website visits by 100% versus the previous year (to 100,000+)</li>
					<li>Reduce overall bounce rate by 50% versus the previous year (to 10%)</li>
					<li>Increase leads generated by 25% versus the previous year (to 1,000+)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>I would have several questions for the person who came up with these objectives:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>What was the rationale for choosing these numbers?</strong> Usually, there wasn't any.</li>
					<li><strong>Do they account for quality?</strong> For example, we might publish more specialised content for our target audience that attracts a lower volume of website traffic, but which is a better fit for our firm. According to our objective, we have failed, as it can’t take this simple nuance into account.</li>
					<li><strong>If, at the end of next year, we haven't met our objective (or exceeded it), what would we do about it?</strong> The answer is the same for both outcomes: nothing. Our objectives aren't actionable.</li>
					<li><strong>If we doubled the desired increase in leads (to 50%), would that change anything about our approach?</strong> Apart from simply spending more on advertising (a rather blunt tactic), our output wouldn’t change based on the size of the value we choose for our objective. Content we publish shouldn’t be driven by arbitrary targets, but by an intrinsic desire to provide value to our target audience.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Additionally, it's deceptively difficult to measure, absorb and utilise KPI data, especially for smaller marketing teams that lack significant resources (usually the case in investment management). One common issue is KPI data not being available in a single location – data on the number of leads generated isn't usually captured in the same place as website visits, for example – and the technological capabilities aren't available to pull them all together to make it easier to monitor and report on them. Plus, even if we could do so, we would still be faced with the previously mentioned flaws of the objectives themselves.</p>
