				<p>Ultimately, a common goal of all investment managers is to grow their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" target="_blank">assets under management (AUM)</a> over time. Generating sales (inflows) of the firm’s products and preventing redemptions (outflows) of money already invested – alongside any rise in the prices of existing investments – contributes to the firm’s AUM growth.</p>
				
				<p>In the business-to-business (B2B) world – in contrast to business-to-consumer (B2C), where marketing can go directly to the end investor – the "heavy lifting" is the responsibility of the sales team. Visitors to a B2B investment management firm's website don't open investment accounts or invest in funds online. Instead, the firm’s sales teams maintain long-term relationships with investment professionals at other businesses and are responsible for generating sales of the firm's products.</p>
				
				<p>Any trades in or out of the firm's products are either handled directly by the sales team or conducted entirely through a third-party investment platform (for example, a financial advisor may use a platform that offers a range of funds, selected from various investment managers, to invest their clients' money). As transaction and holdings data isn't consistently available, it is very difficult – I would say almost impossible – to attribute marketing activity to specific buy and sell orders of the firm's products (despite this, I've seen it attempted a lot, with little success).</p>
