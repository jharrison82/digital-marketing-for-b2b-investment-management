					<p>Ultimately, a common goal of all investment managers is to grow their <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" target="_blank">assets under management (AUM)</a> over time. Generating sales (<strong>inflows</strong>) of the <a href="6-investment-vehicles.html">firm's products</a> and preventing redemptions (<strong>outflows</strong>) of money already invested &mdash; alongside any overall rise in the prices of underlying investments &mdash; contributes to the firm's AUM growth.</p>
					
					<h2 id="marketing-attribution-for-product-flows" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing attribution for product flows</h2>
					
					<p>With an increase in the availability of data and focus on marketing as a business cost, marketing teams are increasingly trying to measure flows into their firm's investment products that have been sourced from, or influenced by, marketing activity.</p>  
					
					<p>However, within <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong> investment management, trades in or out of a firm's products are not made online &mdash; website visitors can't simply open an investment account or invest in products directly through the firm's website. Trades are either handled by the sales team, or conducted entirely through a third-party investment platform, which means that transaction and holdings data often isn't available. This makes it essentially impossible to attribute flows to marketing activity &mdash; even before the myriad of challenges with the attribution itself need to be considered.</p>
															
					<p>Therefore, we won't be trying to attribute product flows to marketing activity.</p>
										
					<h2 id="smart-goals-and-objectives" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">SMART goals and objectives</h2>
									
					<p>There is a general consensus that <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank">SMART goals and objectives</a> should be set for a digital marketing strategy, to help provide some direction. Based on this reasoning, should we create some &mdash; for website visits, leads generated, bounce rates, email opens, and so on &mdash; that the team's performance can be measured against?</p>
					
					<p>My answer is no, for a few reasons. The first is the flaws with the objectives themselves. To help explain what I mean here, let's assume we had an objective to increase website visits by 100% versus the previous year. I would have several questions for the person who came up with this objective:</p>
												
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>What was the rationale for choosing the specific number?</strong> Usually, there wasn't any.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>Can it account for quality?</strong> For example, we might publish more specialised content for our target audience that attracts a lower volume of website traffic, but which is a better fit for our firm. According to our objective, we have failed, as it can’t take this simple nuance into account.</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><strong>If, at the end of next year, we haven't met an objective (or exceeded it), what would we do about it?</strong> The answer is the same for both outcomes: nothing. Our objectives aren't actionable.</li>
						<li><strong>If we doubled the desired increase to 200%, would that change anything about our approach?</strong> Apart from simply spending more on advertising (a rather blunt tactic), our output wouldn’t change based on the size of the value we choose for our objective. </li>
					</ul>

					<p>Secondly, getting the <strong>key performance indicator (KPI)</strong> data we need to measure the objectives can be surprisingly challenging. Data often sits across different systems (such as Google Analytics or the marketing automation system) and teams often lack the technological capabilities to pull them all together in place to make automated reporting possible.</p>

					<p>Thirdly &mdash; and this one is hard to explain &mdash; SMART goals and objectives are very difficult to adopt in practice. Ironically, despite plenty of advice to use them, which is mostly online, I suspect that almost no teams actually do so. This isn't, unfortunately, because they agree with my points, but a combination of ignorance and a real difficulty in making them "stick" into their team's working pattern. Instead, analytics reporting generally consists of a few neglected website reports and an occasional presentation of the outcome of a marketing campaign (usually via a Powerpoint presentation of numbers without context, such as "...we had 32,455 page views"). However, sometimes a colleague comes across a blog post about SMART objectives, and thinking that every other team is using them, they hastily attempt to set some and then hold a regular review meeting. Quickly, however, they inevitably become a dreaded chore, and are eventually abandoned.</p>

					<p>Due to these issues &mdash; the inbuilt flaws, challenges with getting the KPI data, and their difficulty to adopt &mdash; we won't be setting SMART goals and objectives.</p>

					<p>I should point out that there are places where SMART goals and objectives do make sense, as long as sufficient technology resources are available. For example, if a firm has a specific website conversion objective that is directly linked to revenue &mdash; such as applications for a credit card &mdash; the conversion rate can be monitored and optimised over time by analysing large amounts of data and using it to make small, incremental changes to the website (for the credit card company, the conversion rate would be the number of completed applications as a percentage of website visits). However, typical website journeys on B2B investment manager's websites are short and involve simple searches for information, with transactions dealt with elsewhere &mdash; there isn’t much to optimise.</p>
																																						
					<h2 id="goals-and-principles" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Goals and principles</h2>
					
					<p>So, in the place of SMART goal and objectives, what should be used instead?</p>
					
					<p>My suggestion is to not spend much time worrying about it. We can set a single goal &mdash; <strong>support the growth of firm AUM over the long-term</strong> &mdash; and create some guiding principles to keep at the back of our minds:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-3">Focus on producing high-quality and useful content for the firm's target audience, in an appropriate format, to help establish it as a thought leader (regardless of how well that content is expected to "perform").</li>
						<li class="mb-3">Maintain an organic and transparent relationship with the firm's audiences with all your marketing communications: allow people to choose what they want to receive, and only distribute content to those who have explicitly asked to receive it.</li>
						<li>Provide the best possible support to the sales team so they can create and maintain relationships with clients and prospects: providing the materials they need, listening to their feedback, and providing information on what their clients and prospects are engaging with digitally. Ultimately, They are the team that "makes the sale".</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>For any curious colleagues and managers with questions (which happen randomly and are often soon forgotten), we we will make the KPI data we have available through a series of self-serve reports. We will not be beholden to any regular reviews.</p>

					<p>The goal and principles should apply at almost every B2B investment manager, and following the principles should make your colleagues happier, improve the marketing team's relationship with the sales team &mdash; and, most importantly, improve the firm's reputation and credibility with clients and prospects &mdash; over the long-term.</p>
