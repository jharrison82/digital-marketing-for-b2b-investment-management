						<p>From my time in the B2B investment management industry, Iâ€™ve noticed a lot problems with how digital marketing &mdash; and marketing more generally &mdash; is attempted.</p>

						<p>This guide is my attempt at a solution.</p>
						
						<h2 id="problems" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Problems</h2>						
											
						<p>The most serious problems I've seen are listed below:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of industry knowledge</strong>. Marketers tend to have a very poor understanding of even the basics of investment management. In many cases, they have no idea about what their firm does or who their target audience is.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of digital marketing knowledge</strong>. This applies to both technical skills (such as coding) and basic common sense around digital marketing. A lack of expertise makes marketers insecure, keen to impress, and uncomfortable with simplicity &mdash; so they buy impressive-sounding and expensive software with no understanding of how it works, how it will be maintained, or how the huge amounts of data they can generate will be used. Additionally, multiple agencies are often paid huge sums of money to perform basic tasks that should be done internally.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>No direction or strategy</strong>. Marketers rarely have any long-term strategy in place. They are constantly distracted by a mishmash of unfocused projects and tasks, which are often started before the underlying basics are in place. Each poorly-completed or abandoned project adds more mess and unnecessary complexity to existing systems, data, and processes.</li>
							<li><strong>Poor time management</strong>. There is a growing trend, in the digital age, of being constantly busy. A culture of back-to-back meetings, overflowing email inboxes, and cluttered desktops allows no space for independent thinking or ability to effect change.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Here are some example of how these problems can play out in our jobs:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2">At one firm I joined, the marketing team boasted that they had a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake" target="_blank">data lake</a>. I was shocked, as they could barely upload a PDF to the website. However, it soon became clear that it wasn't actually used for anything, was only updated via an occasional manual Excel spreadsheet upload, and was costing the firm a fortune.</li>
							<li>I was once asked to collect registrants of a third-party webinar as leads, which would have to be manually uploaded to the marketing automation system. At that point, however, we didn't collect leads ourselves, or have a process to assign them to a salesperson &mdash; so they would just sit in our database, untouched.</li>
						</ul>
												
						<p>In an industry where the value of marketing is often questioned and hard to quantify, capable and enthusiastic marketers can quickly end up frustrated, disillusioned and demotivated.</p>
