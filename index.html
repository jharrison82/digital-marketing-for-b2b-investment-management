						<p>Investment management firms devise <a href="5-investment-strategies.html">investment strategies</a> and manage <a href="6-investment-vehicles.html">investment products</a> on behalf of investors. Some sell their products to retail investors &mdash; who can purchase them directly through the firm's website &mdash; while others only focus on <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong> relationships.</p>
						
						<p>Salespeople at B2B investment managers attempt to win business from <a href="7-target-audience.html">investment professionals at other firms</a> &mdash; such as financial advisors, fund selectors, or investment consultants &mdash; who can allocate money, either directly or indirectly, into the firm's products. These individuals perform a variety of job functions: managing money, providing investment advice, or making investment products available to groups of retail or professional investors via investment platforms.</p>
												
						<p>From my time in the industry, I’ve noticed several issues with how digital marketing is attempted. This guide is my attempt at a solution.</p>
						
						<h2 id="marketing-issues" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing issues</h2>						
										
						<p>I'll begin with a list of the most serious issues:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of industry knowledge</strong>. Marketers tend to have a very poor understanding of even the basics of investment management. In many cases, they have no idea about what their firm does or who their target audience is.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of digital marketing knowledge</strong>. This applies to both technical skills (such as coding) and basic common sense around digital marketing. A lack of expertise makes marketers insecure, keen to impress, and uncomfortable with simplicity &mdash; so they buy impressive-sounding and expensive software with no understanding of how it works, how it will be maintained, or how the huge amounts of data they can generate will be used. Additionally, multiple agencies are often paid huge sums of money to perform basic tasks that should be done internally.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>No direction or strategy</strong>. Marketers rarely have any long-term strategy in place and are constantly distracted by a mishmash of unfocused projects and tasks, which are often started before the underlying basics are in place. Each poorly-completed or abandoned project adds more mess and unnecessary complexity to existing systems, data, and processes.</li>
							<li><strong>Poor time management</strong>. There is a growing trend, in the digital age, of being constantly busy. A culture of back-to-back meetings, overflowing email inboxes, and cluttered desktops stifles independent thought and ability to effect change.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Here are some examples of how these issues can play out:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2">At one firm I joined, the marketing team boasted that they had a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake" target="_blank">data lake</a>. I was shocked &mdash; they could barely upload a PDF to the website. However, it soon became clear that it wasn't actually used for anything, was only updated via an occasional manual spreadsheet upload, and was costing the firm a fortune.</li>
							<li>I was once asked to collect registrants of a third-party webinar as leads, which would have to be manually uploaded to the marketing automation system. At that point, however, we didn't collect leads ourselves, or have a process to assign them to a salesperson &mdash; so they would just sit in our database, untouched.</li>
						</ul>
												
						<p>To summarise, it's hard to "think big" when you lack expertise, are constantly distracted, and your days are full of meetings with no breaks. In an industry where the value of marketing is often questioned and hard to quantify, capable and enthusiastic marketers can quickly end up frustrated, disillusioned and demotivated.</p>
												
						<h2 id="a-potential-solution" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">A potential solution</h2>
						
						<p>This guide suggests a method for creating and implementing a digital marketing strategy for a B2B investment manager, with some important aspects:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Built step-by-step</strong>. We will create the strategy through a series of steps, rather than jumping from project to project, and use a building block approach: each step will only be started once the previous step has been completed. Any future projects must fit within this infrastructure.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Focus on simplicity</strong>. Unnecessary complexity, external marketing agencies, and expensive software will be avoided. You will discover that you can do much more with less. Additional complexity or costs will only be added if they make sense, and only once the basics are in place. </li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Adapted to each investment manager.</strong> We will perform research on key aspects of our firm &mdash; what it does, the products it offers, and its target audience &mdash; before jumping into the implementation of the strategy, so it can be tailored to fit.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Organic focus</strong>. We will prioritise organic and free digital channels &mdash; such as organic search, email, and social media &mdash; before considering the use of paid advertising.</li>
						</ul>		
												
						<p>While improving outcomes, the approach should also significantly lower marketing spend, with any cost savings ideally passed on to the firm’s clients through lower fees. Marketers will also be given more space and time to think in their jobs.</p>
