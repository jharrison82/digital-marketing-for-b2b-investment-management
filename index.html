						<p>From my time as a digital marketer in the B2B investment management industry, Iâ€™ve noticed several important issues with how digital marketing &mdash; and marketing more generally &mdash; is attempted. This guide is my attempt at a solution.</p>
						
						<h2 id="what-is-b2b-investment-management" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">What is B2B investment management?</h2>				
						
						<p>An investment management firm devises <a href="5-investment-strategies.html">investment strategies</a> and manages <a href="6-investment-vehicles.html">investment products</a> on behalf of investors. Some firms sell their products to retail investors &mdash; who can purchase them directly through the firm's website &mdash; while others focus on <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong> relationships.</p>

						<p>Salespeople at the B2B-focused investment managers are tasked with developing relationships with, and winning business from, <a href="7-target-audience.html">investment professionals at other firms</a> &mdash; such as financial advisors, fund selectors, or investment consultants &mdash; who can allocate money, either directly or indirectly, into the firm's products.</p>
						
						<h2 id="marketing-issues" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing issues</h2>						
										
						<p>Here are the most prominent issues I've seen:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of industry knowledge</strong>. Marketers tend to have a very poor understanding of even the basics of investment management. In many cases, they have no idea about what their firm does or who their target audience is.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of digital marketing knowledge</strong>. This applies to technical skills (such as coding) and, more importantly, a lack of basic common sense. This deficiency make marketers insecure, keen to impress, and uncomfortable with simplicity &mdash; so they buy impressive-sounding and expensive software with no understanding of how it works, how it will be maintained, or how the huge amounts of data they can generate will be used. Additionally, multiple agencies are often paid huge sums of money to perform basic tasks that should be done internally.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>No direction or strategy</strong>. Marketers rarely have any long-term strategy in place and are constantly distracted by a mishmash of unfocused projects and tasks that are often started prematurely. Each poorly-completed or abandoned project adds more mess and unnecessary complexity to existing systems, data, and processes.</li>
							<li><strong>Poor time management</strong>. There is a growing trend, in the digital age, of being constantly busy. A culture of back-to-back meetings, overflowing email inboxes, and cluttered desktops stifles independent thought and ability to effect change.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>And here are some examples of how these issues can play out:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2">At one firm I joined, the marketing team boasted that they had a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake" target="_blank">data lake</a>. I was shocked &mdash; they could barely upload a PDF to the website. However, it soon became clear that it wasn't actually used for anything, was only updated via an occasional manual spreadsheet upload, and was costing the firm a fortune.</li>
							<li>I was once asked to collect registrants of a third-party webinar as leads, which would have to be manually uploaded to the marketing automation system. At that point, however, we didn't collect leads ourselves, or have a process to assign them to a salesperson &mdash; so they would just sit in our database, untouched.</li>
						</ul>
												
						<p>To summarise, it's hard to "think big" and create change when you lack expertise, are constantly distracted, and your days are full of meetings with no breaks. In an industry where the value of marketing is often questioned and hard to quantify, capable and enthusiastic marketers can quickly end up frustrated, disillusioned and demotivated.</p>
												
						<h2 id="a-potential-solution" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">A potential solution</h2>
						
						<p>This guide suggests a method for creating and implementing a digital marketing strategy for a B2B investment manager, with some important characteristics:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Built step-by-step</strong>. Rather than jumping from project to project, we will build up the strategy through a series of steps. Each step is only started once the previous step has been fully completed. Once built, any future projects should "bolt on" to this framework.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Focus on simplicity</strong>. Unnecessary complexity, external marketing agencies, and expensive software will be avoided (you will discover that you can do much more with less). Additional complexity or costs will only be added if they make sense, and only once the basics are in place. </li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Properly prepared.</strong> We will perform important research on key aspects of our firm &mdash; what it does, products it offers, and its target audience &mdash; before jumping into the implementation of the strategy.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Organic focus</strong>. We will prioritise organic and free digital channels &mdash; such as organic search, email, and social media &mdash; before considering the use of paid advertising.</li>
						</ul>		
												
						<p>I believe that implementing the strategy and <a href="2-goals.html#goals-and-principles">applying its key principles</a> will lead to positive outcomes for your firm (such as happier colleagues, better relations between marketing and sales teams, and an improved reputation with clients and prospects).</p>
						
						<p>By eliminating a lot of agency, advertising, and software costs, it can also significantly reduce marketing spend &mdash; with any cost savings ideally passed on to the firm's clients through lower product fees.</p>
					
						<h2 id="challenges" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Challenges</h2>		

						<p>Implementing the strategy in your job won't be easy, especially if you are new. You will inherit systems and processes, with all their flaws, and colleagues will continue to operate the same way they always have: haphazardly starting and abandoning projects and tasks. You can quickly become consumed by it all &mdash; and nothing changes.</p>
						
						<p>It can become a cycle: the same frustrations and inability to implement your ideas come up at a job; you become frustrated, and eventually quit. In the next one, you have to start again from zero, building up your relationship and reputation with colleagues &mdash; and then the same issues come up. It's happened to me.</p>
						
						<p>To break the cycle, I realised I needed to create something that I could show to my next boss to convince them to implement a long-term plan &mdash; one that is unaffected by short term whims of colleagues who come and go. Hopefully, you will be able to use it in a similar way.</p>						
						
						<p>Even when completed in isolation, some individual steps within the strategy &mdash; such as the <a href="#">marketing materials chapter</a> &mdash; can deliver fast results, which should help build trust, and will put you ahead of many investment manager's marketing efforts.</p>
						
						<h2 id="lewisham-asset-management" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham Asset Management</h2>		
						
						<p>To be able to explain and demonstrate various concepts and examples throughout the guide, I have created a fictional B2B investment management firm, called <strong>Lewisham Asset Management</strong> (or "Lewisham" for short).</p>
						
						<p>The firm offer a range of equity and fixed income investment strategies to investors, managed with a clear investment philosophy:</p>
						
						<div class="p-4 mb-3 bg-light">&ldquo;Actively managed and highly concentrated portfolios, built with a strict value investing approach, will deliver optimal and differentiated results for investors&rdquo;.</div>
						
						<p>Generally, this philosophy means the firm's portfolio managers will:</p>

						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong><a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activemanagement.asp" target="_blank">Actively manage</a> portfolios</strong>. Investments are selected from the relevant benchmark index that are believed to have the best long term prospects, rather than simply including all of them.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Construct <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/concentrated-vs-diversified-portfolios-comparing-pros-and-cons.asp" target="_blank">concentrated portfolios</a></strong>. A small number of investments are selected from the relevant benchmark index for portfolio holdings.</li>
							<li><strong>Use a <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp" target="_blank">value investing</a> approach</strong>. Investments are selected that are believed to be underpriced when compared to some intrinsic or book value.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Founded in 1982 in London, the firm has offices in the United Kingdom (London) and the United States (New York City), has 100+ employees, and manages around $40 billion for investors around the world.</p>
						
						<h2 id="who-is-this-guide-for" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Who is this guide for?</h2>
						
						<p>This guide is primarily aimed at digital marketing professionals who work at B2B investment managers, but could also be of interest to members of the wider marketing team, especially Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs), and students and professionals in similar industries.</p>
						
						<h2 id="what-tools-and-software-are-required" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">What tools and software are required?</h2>
											
						<p>To implement the strategy, you will need a website &mdash; with the ability to publish content &mdash; and tools for <a class="external" href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-marketing-automation" target="_blank">marketing automation</a>, <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank">customer relationship management (CRM)</a> and online document storage.</p>
						
						<p>Within the guide, I use <a class="external" href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/b2b-marketing-automation/" target="_blank">Pardot</a> for marketing automation (renamed <strong>Marketing Cloud Account Engagement</strong> in April 2022) and the <a class="external" href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> CRM system.</p>
