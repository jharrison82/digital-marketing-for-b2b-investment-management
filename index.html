						<p>From my time in the investment management industry, Iâ€™ve noticed a lot problems with how digital marketing &mdash; and marketing more generally &mdash; is attempted. There seems to be a few reasons why these problems occur:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of industry knowledge</strong>. Marketers tend to have a very poor understanding of even the basics of investment management. In many cases, they have no idea about what their firm does or who their target audience is.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of digital marketing knowledge</strong>. This applies to both techical skills (such as coding) and basic common sense. It makes marketers insecure and uncomfortable with simplicity, so they buy impressive-sounding and expensive software with no understanding of how it works, will be maintained, or how the huge amounts of data they can generate will be used. Additionally, multiple agencies are often hired, at huge cost, for basic tasks that should be done internally.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>No direction or strategy</strong>. Marketers rarely have any long-term strategy in place and are constantly distracted by a mishmash of unfocused projects and tasks that they constantly start and abandon. Each abandoned or poorly-completed project adds more mess and unnecessary complexity to existing systems, data, and processes.</li>
							<li><strong>Poor time management</strong>. There is a growing trend, in the digital age, of being constantly busy. A culture of back-to-back meetings, overflowing email inboxes, and cluttered desktops allows no space for independent thinking or ability to effect change.</li>
						</ul>
												
						<p>In an industry where the value of marketing is often questioned and hard to quantify, capable and enthusiastic marketers can quickly end up frustrated, disillusioned and demotivated. One of the reasons that I wrote this guide was to help digital marketers educate themselves and be able to present an end-to-end through solution to their management teams and colleagues.</p>
