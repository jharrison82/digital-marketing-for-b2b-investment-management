						<p>In this chapter, we will define the target audience for your firm. We will begin by listing typical organisations that work with B2B managers, document how sales teams are organised at your firm to cover these organisations, and then look at the specific subset of individuals who work at these organisations that are of interest to salespeople.<p>
						
						<h2 id="target-organisations" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Target organisations</h2>	
						
						<p>The typical organisations that B2B managers work with can be split into two main client groups (or channels): <strong>institutional</strong> and <strong>intermediary</strong>.</p>
						
						<h3 id="institutional-client-group" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Institutional client group</h3>
						
						<p>The institutional client group is made up of <strong>institutions</strong> and <strong>institutional investment consultants &amp; OCIOs</strong>.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Institutions</strong> are organizations that need to invest money on behalf of others, or the institution itself. Examples include pension funds (who need to invest money coming from contributions of plan participants), insurance firms (from premiums paid by customers), or sovereign wealth funds (from oil revenues). Often, they have some form of internal investment committee or board of trustees that decides overall investment strategy and hires investment managers to manage portions of the institution's portfolio.</p>
						
						<p>A more comprehensive list of institutions includes public and corporate pension funds, family offices, endowments, foundations, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance firms. There are others &mdash; such as hedge funds, mutual funds, and REITs &mdash; but these donâ€™t seem to be typical clients of B2B investment managers.</p>
						
						<p>Institutions that lack investment expertise can outsource the work to an <strong>institutional investment consultant</strong> or a provider of <strong>outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO)</strong> services. Both can help with <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp" target="_blank">asset allocation</a> (dividing the institution's portfolio between asset classes) and <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manager_of_managers.asp" target="_blank">manager selection</a> (choosing which investment managers to hire for each allocation). However, unlike consultants, OCIOs can typically make discretionary decisions on the institution's behalf &mdash; so the institution can essentially outsource the entire investment team. Confusingly, some of the larger investment managers offer OCIO services.</p>
						
						<h3 id="intermediary-client-group" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Intermediary client group</h3>
						
						<p>The intermediary client group is made up of <strong>financial advisors</strong> and <strong>investment platforms</strong>.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Financial advisors</strong> are organisations that provide various forms of financial advice to individuals (called retail investors). They are typically an independent firm, or may form part of a larger organisation &mdash; such as the wealth management department (or subsidiary) of a bank.</p>
						
						<p>An <strong>investment platform</strong> allows groups of retail or financial advisors to buy and sell a range of investment products, offered by a variety of investment managers, in one place. They are used by financial advisors to manage their clients' portfolios, and retail investors to manage their personal investments. Retail platforms are sometimes known as <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fund-supermarkets.asp" target="_blank">fund supermarkets</a>.</p>
						
						<p>A financial advisor firm may have its own investment platform.</p>>
