					<p>In this chapter, I will describe the long-term strategy that will be used to attempt to meet the goal and align with the principles that were <a href="2-goals.html#goals-and-principles">created in the previous chapter</a>.</p>
					
					<h2 id="strategy-overview" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Strategy overview</h2>
										
					<p>Our top priority is to help the sales team nurture relationships with their clients and prospects (aligning with the <a href="2-goals.html#principle-1">first principle</a>). To do so, we will <strong>provide information</strong> to salespeople about the digital activity of their assigned clients and prospects.</p>

					<p>To be able to provide this information, we will build up a database of contacts in the marketing automation system &mdash; whose digital activity can be tracked &mdash; by offering <strong>website subscriptions</strong>. Website visitors are added to the database when they submit a subscription form, and notified by email any time content is published on topics they have expressed an interest in (aligning with <a href="2-goals.html#principle-2">principle 2</a>).</p>
					
					<p>Any members of the database who are not already known to the sales teams will be vetted and passed on to an appropriate salesperson, to help create new relationships.</p> 
					
					<p>To encourage visitors to subscribe, and to attract new audiences, we will <strong>publish content</strong> that the firm's target audience finds valuable (aligning with <a href="2-goals.html#principle-3">principle 3</a>). By distributing this content to members of the database via subscription, we also encourage digital activity that will enhance the information that salespeople receive.</p>
					
					<p>In order to make all this possible, we begin by making sure the basics are in place, create a robust digital marketing infrastructure, and look at examples of how additional projects can be fitted into this infrastructure.</p>
					
					<h2 id="marketing-automation-database" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing automation database</h2>
					
					<p>The strategy is centred around the <strong>marketing automation database</strong> of contacts who have submitted their personal details through a form on the firm's website &mdash; to subscribe, download gated content, or get in touch &mdash; at some point.</p>

					<p>Each time a previously anonymous website visitor submits a form, a new contact record is created in the database with the personal information provided (name, email address, company, and so on). A cookie is set on the visitor's device that allows the marketing automation system to track further digital activity of the  contact &mdash; such as visits to the firm's website, email engagement, and file downloads &mdash; made on the same device. This activity is stored on the contact's record.</p>
					
					<p>When the form is submitted, the marketing automation system checks if the provided details match any records in the firm's <strong>customer relationship management (CRM)</strong> system (a database used by the sales team use to record any meetings, phone calls, and other interactions with clients and prospects). If a matching CRM record is found &mdash; indicating the contact is known to the firm and has an assigned salesperson &mdash; the contact record is created in the marketing automation system, linked to the relevant CRM record, and assigned to the same salesperson; otherwise, an un-linked record is created, with no salesperson assigned.</p> 
					
					<p>This means the marketing automation database usually contains a mix of contacts with an exisiting CRM record and newly-generated leads, each of which can be defined as a:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-3"><strong>Lead</strong> &mdash; someone who has submitted their personal details and has no CRM record. A new contact record was created in the marketing automation database, but was not qualified by the marketing team as a prospect.</li>
						<li class="mb-3"><strong>Prospect</strong> &mdash; also known as a <strong>marketing qualified lead (MQL)</strong>. A lead who has been qualified by the marketing team as a potential opportunity based on that contact's personal details (company, job title, location). At this stage, they will not have a CRM record or an assigned sales person.
						<li class="mb-3"><strong>Opportunity</strong> &mdash; also known as a <strong>sales qualified lead (SQL)</strong>. A prospect who has either had a CRM record created after they entered the marketing automation database, or already had a CRM record when their record in the marketing automation database was created. Although all opportunities will have a CRM record, some may have never invested any money with the firm, or may no longer hold any investments.</li>
					</ul>		
																				
 					<h2 id="strategy-implementation" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Strategy implementation</h2>
					
					<p>The strategy is implemented through a series of steps.</p>
										
					<h3 id="firm-research" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Step #1: Firm research</h3>
					
					<p>A key initial step &mdash; and something I have never seen attempted &mdash; involves comprehensively researching and documenting key aspects of your firm: <a href="">business overview</a>, <a href="">products &amp; services offered</a>, <a href="">target audience</a>, <a href="">sales team structure</a>, and <a href="">languages used</a>.</p>
				
					<h3 id="groundwork" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Step #2: Groundwork</h3>
					
					<p>Next, to make sure the basics are in place, we complete some important groundwork around <a href="">marketing materials</a>, <a href="">website &amp; SEO</a>, and <a href="">content publishing</a>.</p>
