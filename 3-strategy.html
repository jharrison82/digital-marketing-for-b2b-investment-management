				<p>With a <a href="2-goals.html#goals-and-principles">goal in place</a>, we can now focus on how we are going to achieve it.</p>
					
					<h2 id="strategy-overview" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Strategy overview</h2>
				
				  <p>At a high level, the strategy will cover four main areas: (1) publishing content for the firm's target audience, (2) offering website subscriptions to build up the marketing automation database of contacts whose digital activity can be tracked, (3) distributing content to members of the marketing automation database, and (4) providing the sales team with information about the digital activity of their clients and prospects who are members of the marketing automation database.</p>
					
					<h2 id="marketing-automation-database" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing automation database</h2>
					
					<p>The strategy is centred around the firm's <strong>marketing automation database</strong>. This is the database of contacts stored within the marketing automation system. We want to build this database as much as we can – which will include both new prospects and existing clients – because we will be able to track a contacts engagement with the firm’s digital content (website, emails, documents, and so on) at an individual level.</p>
					
					<h2 id="strategy-implementation" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Strategy implementation</h2>
					
					<p>The strategy is implemented through a series of steps:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Firm research</strong>. Perform research on and document important aspects of the firm.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Groundwork</strong>. Complete important preparatory work and start regularly publishing blog content on the firm's website (if you aren't already).</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Lead generation and management</strong>. Set up the digital marketing infrastructure to grow and manage the marketing automation database and notify salespeople of interesting digital activity.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Content distribution</strong>. Start distributing content to segments of the marketing database via email, to encourage digital activity.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Expansion projects</strong>. Undertake any relevant projects, ensuring they are integrated with the work done so far.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h3 id="firm-research" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Firm research</h3>
					
					<p>A key initial step &mdash; and something I have never seen attempted &mdash; involves comprehensively researching and documenting key aspects of your firm (such as its defining characteristics, investment products, target audience, and so on). This research will allow the digital marketing teams to properly understand the firm they work for, and tailor the approach to fit.</p>		
				
					<h3 id="groundwork" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Groundwork</h3>
					
					<p>We must then complete some important groundwork: ensuring the firm’s website has key components in place (and if not, adding them) and reviewing how documents and marketing materials are managed. We also begin publishing content on the website.</p>
					
					<h3 id="groundwork" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lead generation and management</h3>
					
					<p>Next, we build the digital marketing infrastructure, centred around the firm's database of contacts stored within the marketing automation system. We want to build this database as much as we can – which will include both new prospects and existing clients – because we will be able to track a contacts engagement with the firm's digital content (website, emails, documents, and so on) at an individual level.</p>
					
					<p>To grow our database, we will create forms in the marketing automation system and place them on the firm’s website. When a previously anonymous visitor to the website submits a form – to subscribe, download gated content, or get in touch – a new contact record is created for them in the marketing automation database.</p>
					
					<p>Personal information submitted in the form is stored on the contacts record (such as their name, email address, and company) in the marketing automation database. When a form is submitted, the marketing automation system should check if the provided details match any records in the firm’s customer relationship management (CRM) system (the sales team’s database of their clients and prospects in which meetings, phone calls, and other interactions are recorded). If a matching CRM record is found – indicating the person is known to the firm and has a salesperson assigned – the contact record will be created in the marketing automation system and linked to this CRM record (and assigned to the same salesperson); otherwise, an un-linked record is created, with no salesperson assigned.</p>
					
					<p>In either case, a cookie is set on the computer of the person submitting the form that allows the marketing automation system to track their digital activity (including any further visits to the firm’s website, email engagement, and file downloads). This tracked activity can be viewed on the contact record in the marketing database and any linked CRM record. It’s a key part of the digital marketing strategy.</p>
					
					<p>For the newly generated contact records without assigned sales coverage (which we could consider to be “owned” by marketing), we next set up an automated process to filter out those which are a fit for the firm as a potential client, and manage how and when they are handed over to sales for an initial follow-up:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-3">As not all newly generated leads will be potential clients, we can “grade” each lead based on the details they submit in the contact form. This grade – calculated in the marketing automation system – represents how well a lead matches with a set of our “ideal” criteria; we can use a minimum grade threshold to determine if a lead can be eventually passed to the sales team. However, if you believe the volume of leads your activities will generate is sufficiently low, you may decide to skip lead grading and simply manually review every new lead that comes in.</li>
						<li class="mb-3">It's probably not a good idea to send vetted leads over to sales as soon as they are generated: the contacts will need time to engage with content. We can add a delay between a lead being generated and any initial sales follow-up, by using an engagement score for each lead – starting at zero and increasing each time they engage in digital activity – and setting a minimum score that needs to be reached (alongside any minimum grade) before a new lead is passed over to the sales team. The amount of delay will be inversely related to the level of digital activity: leads engaging with lots of content will be passed over sooner. Admittedly, the choice of minimum score can be a bit arbitrary, but it can be tested and tweaked over time until a suitable balance is found.</li>
						<li class="mb-3">We also need to determine the specific details of how leads are handed over to the sales team: which salesperson they are sent to, how they are reviewed, and how any leads that are qualified and accepted by the sales team are pushed into the CRM and assigned to a salesperson that will cover them. Having a clear understanding of the sales team structure and process is key at this stage.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 id="content-distribution" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Content distribution</h3>
					
					<p>Once the digital marketing infrastructure is in place, we begin distributing content to the marketing database via email, which should encourage digital activity (alongside, of course, any activities members take of their own accord that aren't driven by marketing) and provide the "fuel" for the sales notifications.</p>
				
					<h3 id="expansion projects" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Expansion projects</h3>
					
					<p>Finally, we may wish to undertake additional digital marketing projects. Ideally, we want to incorporate these within our existing infrastructure as much as possible. Therefore, I will work through a selection of typical investment management-related projects and demonstrate how they can be incorporated into our existing infrastructure.</p>
