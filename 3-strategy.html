				<p>In this chapter, I will describe the long-term strategy that will be put in place to attempt to meet the goal and align with the principles that were <a href="2-goals.html#goals-and-principles">created in the previous chapter</a>.</p>
					
				<h2 id="strategy-overview" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Strategy overview</h2>
				
				  <p>At a high level, the strategy covers four main areas:</p>

					<ol>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Publishing content</strong> for the firm's target audience.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Offering website subscriptions</strong> to build up a database of contacts whose digital activity can be tracked.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Distributing content</strong> to members of the database to encourage digital activity.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Providing salespeople with information</strong> about the digital activity of specific clients and prospects who are members of the database.</li>
					</ol>
										
					<h2 id="marketing-automation-database" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing automation database</h2>
					
					<p>The strategy is centred around the <strong>marketing automation database</strong>, which is made up of contacts who have submitted their personal details through a form on the firm's website &mdash; to subscribe, download gated content, or get in touch &mdash; at some point. It is stored within the marketing automation system.</p>

					<p>When a previously anonymous website visitor submits a form, a new contact record is created in the database with the personal information provided in the form (such as their name, email address, and company). A cookie is set on the visitor's device that allows the marketing automation system to track further digital activity of the  contact &mdash; such as visits to the firm's website, email engagement, and file downloads &mdash; made on the same device. This activity is stored on the contact's record.</p>
					
					<p>At the point of form submission, the marketing automation system checks if the provided details match any records in the firm's <strong>customer relationship management (CRM)</strong> system, which is sales team's database of their clients and prospects in which meetings, phone calls, and other interactions are recorded. If a matching CRM record is found &mdash; indicating the contact is known to the firm and has an assigned salesperson &mdash; the contact record is created in the marketing automation system, linked to the relevant CRM record, and assigned to the same salesperson; otherwise, an un-linked record is created, with no salesperson assigned.</p> 
					
					<p>This means the marketing automation database usually contains a mix of contacts with an exisiting CRM record and newly-generated leads, each of which can be defined as a:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-3"><strong>Lead</strong> &mdash; someone who has submitted their personal details and has no CRM record. A new contact record was created in the marketing automation database, but was not qualified by the marketing team as a prospect.</li>
						<li class="mb-3"><strong>Prospect</strong> &mdash; also known as a <strong>marketing qualified lead (MQL)</strong>. A lead who has been qualified by the marketing team as a potential opportunity based on that contact's personal details (company, job title, location). At this stage, they will not have a CRM record or an assigned sales person.
						<li class="mb-3"><strong>Opportunity</strong> &mdash; also known as a <strong>sales qualified lead (SQL)</strong>. A prospect who has either had a CRM record created after they entered the marketing automation database, or already had a CRM record when their record in the marketing automation database was created. Although they all have a CRM record, they may have never invested any money with the firmm, or may no longer hold any investments.</li>
					</ul>		
															
					<h2 id="strategy-implementation" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Strategy implementation</h2>
					
					<p>The strategy is implemented through a series of steps:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Firm research</strong>. Perform research on and document important aspects of the firm.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Groundwork</strong>. Complete important preparatory work and start regularly publishing blog content on the firm's website (if you aren't already).</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Lead generation and management</strong>. Set up the digital marketing infrastructure to grow and manage the marketing automation database and notify salespeople of interesting digital activity.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Content distribution</strong>. Start distributing content to segments of the marketing database via email, to encourage digital activity.</li>
						<li class="ps-2 mb-2"><strong>Expansion projects</strong>. Undertake any additional projects, ensuring they are integrated with the work done so far.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h3 id="firm-research" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Firm research</h3>
					
					<p>A key initial step &mdash; and something I have never seen attempted &mdash; involves comprehensively researching and documenting key aspects of your firm (such as its defining characteristics, products &amp; services, target audience, and so on). This research will allow the digital marketing team to properly understand the firm they work for, and tailor the approach to fit.</p>		
				
					<h3 id="groundwork" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Groundwork</h3>
					
					<p>We must then complete some important groundwork: ensuring the firm’s website has key components in place (and if not, adding them) and reviewing how documents and marketing materials are managed. We also begin publishing content on the website.</p>
					
					<h3 id="lead-generation-and-management" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lead generation and management</h3>
					
					<p>Next, we build the digital marketing infrastructure, centred around the firm's database of contacts stored within the marketing automation system. We want to build this database as much as we can – which will include both new prospects and existing clients – because we will be able to track a contacts engagement with the firm's digital content (website, emails, documents, and so on) at an individual level.</p>
					
					<p>To grow our database, we will create forms in the marketing automation system and place them on the firm’s website. When a previously anonymous visitor to the website submits a form – to subscribe, download gated content, or get in touch – a new contact record is created for them in the marketing automation database.</p>
					
					<p>For the newly generated contact records without assigned sales coverage (which we could consider to be “owned” by marketing), we next set up an automated process to filter out those which are a fit for the firm as a potential client, and manage how and when they are handed over to sales for an initial follow-up:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="mb-3">As not all newly generated leads will be potential clients, we can “grade” each lead based on the details they submit in the contact form. This grade – calculated in the marketing automation system – represents how well a lead matches with a set of our “ideal” criteria; we can use a minimum grade threshold to determine if a lead can be eventually passed to the sales team. However, if you believe the volume of leads your activities will generate is sufficiently low, you may decide to skip lead grading and simply manually review every new lead that comes in.</li>
						<li class="mb-3">It's probably not a good idea to send vetted leads over to sales as soon as they are generated: the contacts will need time to engage with content. We can add a delay between a lead being generated and any initial sales follow-up, by using an engagement score for each lead – starting at zero and increasing each time they engage in digital activity – and setting a minimum score that needs to be reached (alongside any minimum grade) before a new lead is passed over to the sales team. The amount of delay will be inversely related to the level of digital activity: leads engaging with lots of content will be passed over sooner. Admittedly, the choice of minimum score can be a bit arbitrary, but it can be tested and tweaked over time until a suitable balance is found.</li>
						<li class="mb-3">We also need to determine the specific details of how leads are handed over to the sales team: which salesperson they are sent to, how they are reviewed, and how any leads that are qualified and accepted by the sales team are pushed into the CRM and assigned to a salesperson that will cover them. Having a clear understanding of the sales team structure and process is key at this stage.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 id="content-distribution" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Content distribution</h3>
					
					<p>Once the digital marketing infrastructure is in place, we begin distributing content to the marketing database via email, which should encourage digital activity (alongside, of course, any activities members take of their own accord that aren't driven by marketing) and provide the "fuel" for the sales notifications.</p>
				
					<h3 id="expansion-projects" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Expansion projects</h3>
					
					<p>Finally, we may wish to undertake additional digital marketing projects. Ideally, we want to incorporate these within our existing infrastructure as much as possible. Therefore, I will work through a selection of typical investment management-related projects and demonstrate how they can be incorporated into our existing infrastructure.</p>
